I attended a meeting, shared a bit about what we were doing, and a few people volunteered. Within a few days, we had a four person crew working on our site - of which Sunny was one. <br><br>During the course of the site being developed, the team was extremely helpful, worked diligently to get the site done in a timely manner and often made suggestions on how we could improve our site. Our site was built using Wordpress as the CMS. Sunny integrated online donation capabilities, a dynamic contact form, an animated timeline, and implemented custom page templates to achieve the look we wanted. He wrote custom functions, styled pages to look great with CSS, and made sure everything was responsive for visitors using any device.
